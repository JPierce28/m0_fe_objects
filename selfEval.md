# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - Building the key-value pair in the email exercise. It was helpful to have a couple examples to lead me in the correct direction.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - I find the most helpful notes are the ones with vocabulary and syntax. It helps me understand the point of each assignment.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - I first try to solve the problem on my own. I read the practice exercise and try to take any syntax out so I know what I'm trying to accomplish. If I can't figure out what to write, then I got to google.
